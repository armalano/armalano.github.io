      <p class=padding>On a brisk March afternoon, I received a call from Galway, New York. It was my dad. He had called to inform me that he just got back from the local Stewart’s, and he had to pay over four dollars a gallon to fill up his *bleeping* tank with gas. While this may sound like an overreaction, my dad was one of many Americans shocked and frustrated by the unusual spike in gas prices two months ago that has not subsided much today.</p>

      <p class=padding>The reason for this spike? Russia’s war in Ukraine. According to Michael Wasylenko, Maxwell Advisory Board Professor Emeritus of Economics, nominal and real gas prices have increased over the long term due to an uptick in demand. There are more cars on the road and more miles driven each year both in the state of New York and the United States as a whole. However, this longer term trend in prices is often interrupted by disruptions in the supply of crude oil, such as the present war.</p>

      <p class=padding>Biden’s announcement of a ban on Russian oil imports in early March caused prices to skyrocket in a season where gas prices typically start to increase anyways. Wasylenko said that New York follows similar trends in pricing to the United States as a whole, and weekly average retail gas reported for March 14th reached well over four dollars for all regions in the state. The highest weekly average was in White Plains, which saw about $4.68 per gallon. The difference between the highest and lowest price during this period was only about 30 cents, with Batavia’s weekly average price hitting $4.36 per gallon.</p>

      <p class=padding>When the average American thinks about an uptick in gas prices, they often consider how much more it will cost to drive their car. However, most would not think about the effect of high gas prices on small businesses.</p>

      <p class="pullquote"> 

      "All plastic has oil in it, and with a lot of products small businesses use input prices go way up because oil is up." <b> - Professor Michael Wasylenko </b>

      </p>

      <p class=padding>Prior to the spike, New York was already seeing a steady increase in prices as the pandemic started to be contained and Americans hit the roads to travel and visit friends and family again. Yet, Wasylenko said that during the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, with the loss of jobs and working at home with reduced miles driven, demand for oil and gasoline fell sharply. Taking a look at the data in New York State, prices hit record lows in May 2020, where New York saw weekly averages of $2.16 per gallon, which was down over $0.50 from just a few months before. $2.16 in 2020 to the high weekly average of $4.44 reported on March 14th, 2022 is quite the jump.</p>

      <p class=padding>Wasylenko referenced the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009 as a historic time period in the United States where the disruption of economic cycles to the long-term trend in prices was on full display. New York State weekly average gas prices peaked at about $4.31 during the summer of 2008 right before the economy crashed. The crash resulted in a deep recession where average prices fell as low as $1.83 in January of 2009. Filling up your tank for under two dollars per gallon would seem like a dream to most Americans today. Yet, prices rose gradually as the economy slowly recovered and demand for gas increased. Weekly average prices reached $2.85 as the Great Recession ended in June of 2009.</p>

      <p class=padding>Wasylenko said that he expects a similar outcome to occur with the current situation involving Russia’s war in Ukraine. After the war ends, Wasylenko said he believes prices of gasoline will return to pre-war levels. However, the decline will be gradual and the prices will then be subject to the business cycles in the economy.</p>

      <p class=padding>“If there’s a recession as some people fear, then miles driven will go down, people take fewer vacations, they drive less, so you’ll see some moderation in prices because the markets hate uncertainty,” Wasylenko said.</p>

      <p class=padding>Today, the introduction of electric vehicles could alter the traditional economic cycles relating to gas for good. Companies from Tesla to Ford are competing to be at the top of the electric vehicle market as more environmentally conscious consumers are starting to make the switch for the sake of our planet. Wasylenko said that if the price is right, many consumers would likely be willing to go electric due to the various benefits of owning an electric vehicle over a traditional one.</p>

      <p class=padding>“They require very little maintenance, there’s no oil, you basically just rotate the tires and hope the battery charges,” Wasylenko said.</p>

      <p class=padding>Wasylenko said the adoption of electric vehicles will reduce the demand for gasoline and oil, cause the price of gas to decline and finally reverse the upward trend over the long term. Yet, only time will tell how rapid the adoption of electric vehicles will be.</p>
